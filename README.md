# This is my habit tracking app created to track, break or continue with user defined habits.

The files included are as follows, a technical analysis and requirements to create the program as well as the first draft flow-chart, stored in 'Conception_Phase_1'.
A slide presentation document which decribes the tools which was used to ceate the project, how to run the program, and how the interface work and what it looks like, stored in 'Updated_Development_Phase_2'.
There is another slide presentation which was created on how to run tests within the program, which is used to tests certain results returned from the program, stored in 'Python_Tests'.

There is also a Python file called 'Data_Insert', this file should not be ran, as it is only the code used to insert previous data. You can view these code files in any code editor.
Lastly is a file called 'Habits' which is a databse file on which the code is stored, and is also essentially needed for the program to work.

What has been added:
-A feature that tests the program has been added with pytest. This will test if the correct results are returned when a user wants to check for a certain habit.
-A PDF document on how to run the test within the program has also been created.

What has been updated:
-The flow-chart has been updated and now contains the ability to see the previous 4 weeks of test data under Habit Analysis
-The PDF document on how to run the program has also been updated, and now contains instructions on how to run the program ffrom command line.
